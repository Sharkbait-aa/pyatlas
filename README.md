# PyAtlas

PyAtlas is a personal Python learning lab.

Right now it is very simple:
- It runs a small Python code snippet.
- It shows whether it succeeded.
- It shows any printed output.
- It shows the final values of the variables in that snippet.

The goal is to grow this into a tool where I can:
- Experiment with Python code.
- See what variables equal at the end of a run.
- Eventually connect code examples to specific Python commands (like `sorted`, `len`, etc.) to help me learn.
